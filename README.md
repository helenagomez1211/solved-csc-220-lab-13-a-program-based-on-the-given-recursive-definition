In this lab, you are going to implement a program based on the given recursive definition.

Modify the method that calculates the sum of the integers between 1 and <em>N </em>shown in slides. Have the new version named Sum.java match the following recursive definition: The sum of 1 to <em>N</em>â€¨is the sum of 1 to (<em>N</em>/2) plus the sum of (<em>N</em>/2 + 1) to <em>N</em>. Use your program to trace your solution with an <em>N </em>of 7. Then take a screen shot of the trace and keep the file in your Lab 13 folder. Your program should ask user to input a number <em>N </em>and calculate the sum of 1 to <em>N</em>. Exceptions should be handled properly
